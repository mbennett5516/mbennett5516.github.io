      <p>
        I'm a Full-Stack Developer living in the Dallas, TX area. I studied Full MERN Stack Web 
        Development through the SMU Bootcamp program. I graduated in December 2018 and since 
        January, I have been working as a Junior Developer at TEKsystems and adding to my skill set.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since being hired at TEKsystems as a full-time contractor, I have begun to focus my skills more on 
        back-end development. I have learned core Java, object-oriented programming and design principles, 
        and the Spring 5 framework. I am currently studying for the Oracle Java 8 certification exam.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also have previous programming experience as a student at DeVry University. There, I
        studied C++ for nearly 2 years. Although I haven't used C++ in several years, the
        skills that I learned there have helped me become more proficient in back-end programming more 
        quickly than my peers. I learned a lot about the logic that goes into programming, how the computer 
        decipers code, and might prioritize one command over others, and basic Computer Science lessons.
