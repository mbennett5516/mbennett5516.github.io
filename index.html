      <p>
        I'm a novice web developer based out of Irving, Texas. I will obtain a
        certificate for the completion of a Full-Stack Web Development
        course offered by SMU in December 2018, proving that I have what
        it takes to be a fully-fledged Junior Developer. I will then receive
        an offer of employment as a Junior Developer with TEKsystems and work
        out of their office here in Irving, Texas. I'd like to work on App Development,
        but of course, that may change as I grow and learn throughout the Boot Camp
        experience. I might find myself learning something that really speaks to me
        as a proffessional, and follow that skill down a career path.
      </p>

        I have a little self-taught experience that's been helping me get through
        the boot camp so far. While working as a security guard, I downloaded the SoloLearn
        app for iPhone, and began teaching myself how to use HTML and CSS. I figured if I was
        going to be paid to sit at a desk for 8 hours per day, I might as well fight off the
        boredom and do something productive at the same time. After learning a bit of each
        language, I would practice developing webpages from scratch on Notepad documents, which
        was MUCH more difficult than using an IDE like VS Code!
      </p>
      <p>
        I also have previous programming experience as a student at DeVry University. There, I
        studied C++ for nearly 2 years. Although we won't be going over C++ in our Boot Camp, the
        skills that I learned there have already paid off in the Boot Camp. I learned a lot about
        the logic that goes into programming, how the computer reads your code, and might prioritize
        one command over others, and the game logic I learned helped me greatly in the Scratch game
        project in the pre-work.
