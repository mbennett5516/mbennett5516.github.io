        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>
            I'm a novice web developer based out of Irving, Texas. I will obtain a 
            certificate for the completion of a Full-Stack Web Development 
            course offered by SMU in December 2018, proving that I have what 
            it takes to be a fully-fledged Junior Developer. I will then receive 
            an offer of employment as a Junior Developer with TEKsystems and work 
            out of their office here in Irving, Texas. I'd like to work on App Development, 
            but of course, that may change as I grow and learn throughout the Boot Camp 
            experience. I might find myself learning something that really speaks to me 
            as a proffessional, and follow that skill down a career path.
        </p>

            I have a little self-taught experience that's been helping me get through 
            the boot camp so far. While working as a security guard, I downloaded the SoloLearn 
            app for iPhone, and began teaching myself how to use HTML and CSS. I figured if I was 
            going to be paid to sit at a desk for 8 hours per day, I might as well fight off the 
            boredom and do something productive at the same time. After learning a bit of each 
            language, I would practice developing webpages from scratch on Notepad documents, which 
            was MUCH more difficult than using an IDE like VS Code!
        </p>

            I also have previous programming experience as a student at DeVry University. There, I 
            studied C++ for nearly 2 years. Although we won't be going over C++ in our Boot Camp, the 
            skills that I learned there have already paid off in the Boot Camp. I learned a lot about 
            the logic that goes into programming, how the computer reads your code, and might prioritize 
            one command over others, and the game logic I learned helped me greatly in the Scratch game 
            project in the pre-work.
